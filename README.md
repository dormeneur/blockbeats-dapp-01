# BlockBeats

A Blockchain based NFT music player application.

**What is it?**

BlockBeats is a music player that lets you play music you own as NFTs on the blockchain. Think of it like your personal, decentralized Spotify, but for your NFT music collection.

**What's working?**

Right now, the basics are in place: you can connect your wallet and the app will recognize your connected status.

**Coming Soon...**

This project is still under development, with lots more planned. Stay tuned for updates!
